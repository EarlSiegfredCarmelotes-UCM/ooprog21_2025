/* Bugs:
 * 1. In java, you can't put space in a class name. once your class name is separated in two words, it will cause error.
 * 2. Input "main" (lowercase) instead of "Main".
 * 3. String needs to have both an open and close square parenthesis ( [] ).
 * 4. It has missing "e" in ( Systm.out.println ).
 * 5. No semi colon in the end of ("Hello World!").
 * 6. No closing bracket in the end of the code ( } ).
